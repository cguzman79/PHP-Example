			       By using this system you are agreeing not to falsify personal information for the purpose of creating an

				   it creates a large inconvenience for those tutors and staff that the appointments are scheduled with.
				   The TATeRS system is provided as a helpful tool for staff, tutors, and students.  Because of this, using the
				   system implies that the user is agreeing not to disclose any personal information about any others that may,
				   or may not be available to them.  It is also imperative that anyone using the system does not use the 
				   scheduling functions for the any purpose rather than what it is intended for.  This also goes for any of
				   the other functions provided by the TATeRS system.</label>
